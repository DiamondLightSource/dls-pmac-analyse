14/02/2020: Found bad character (M) before comment line at start of
            file BRICK_M_variables today with todays date and fgz73762
            Jon Thompson ownership, even though he has long gone.
            There was old emacs file with ownership tow31676, maybe it
            was them.

            The problem caused dls-pmacAnalyse.py to crash, so I
            copied the file to another file with the suffix _BAD and
            have edited the file to remove the bad character, I did
            nothing further, that's why the old emacs file and the bad
            file have my ownership and today's date, but I did not
            actually change any of the actual definitions.

            Tested and its now working.
